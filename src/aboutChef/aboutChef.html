      <h3>About Me!</h3>
      <p>Hello fellow foodies! My name is Nestor and like you, I too have to eat food in order to survive. So why not
         make it as good of a time as we can? This website is a guide so that you can live like me 
         (I don't actually live like this). Everyone likes good food and cheap meals, so why not combine the two?</p>

      <h3>My Inspirations</h3>
      <p>As you have seen, I like to follow my colleague and very close friend Gusteau's motto. So much so that I have
         based my branding off of him (please don't sue me Disney). I have chosen to act on those feelings, and I have 
         prepared these meals for everyone to enjoy. They always turn out great, but please don't check under my chef hat,
         nothing is under here :).</p>
